# punch-out-wii-noesis-plugin
A noesis plugin to extract Punch-Out!! Wii models with their meshes and rig.

Huge thanks to the kind and wonderful people at the XeNTaX server who helped make this possible by identifying a lot of sections that I could not see before and assisting with sections of the code. Their help has been invaluable, and this wouldn't have been possible without them!

Limitations:
- You'll need to obtain the models textures yourself by other means.
- I also do not have the UV maps decoded yet either, so you'll have to set those yourself as well.

# How to use:
1. [Get the Noesis program here.](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php)
2. Download the fmt_powiidict.py file from this repository.
3. Extract the .zip file the program comes in. 
4. Go to ../noesisv4466/plugins/python
5. Move the fmt_powiidict.py to the python folder.
6. Open Noesis and start exploring!
